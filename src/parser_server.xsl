/* A duration that is associated with a PANA session. For an
established PANA session, the session lifetime is bound to the
lifetime of the current authorization given to the PaC. The
session lifetime can be extended by a new round of EAP
authentication before it expires. Until a PANA session is
established, the lifetime SHOULD be set to a value that allows the
PaC to detect a failed session in a reasonable amount of time.
