Installation
============

These are installation instructions for Unix and Unix-like systems
that can run the "configure" script in this same directory. These
are not the installation instructions for Windows systems.

  1. OpenPANA requires the following libraries:

  - OpennSSL library
    http://wwww.openssl.org

  - Libxml2
    http://xmlsoft.org/

 2. Configuring OpenPANA:

    Default settings can be changed by modifying the config.xml file found in ./src and /etc/openpana when installed.
    * Common Settings:
    - IP version <IP_VERSION>
	- Interface <INTERFACE>
	- Port <PORT>
	- Session Timeout: Lifetime of the session. <SESSION><TIMEOUT>
	- PRF Algorithms: Supported PRF Algorithms. <ALGORITHMS><PRF>
	- Integrity Algorithms: Supported Integrity Algorithms. <ALGORITHMS><INTEGRITY>
    - PaC's Settings <PAC>
	- Client's EAP username <USER>
	- Client's EAP password <PASSWORD>
	- Client's Certificates files, located under the configuration directory after installation or otherwise under
	  the directory where the executable is launched from. The name of the files may be changed by modifying this values.
		- CA Certificate Filename <CA_CERT>
		- Client's Certificate Filename <CLIENT_CERT>
		- Client's key <CLIENT_KEY>
		- Client's private key <PRIVATE_KEY>
	- Fragment Size <FRAGMENT_SIZE>

	* PaC's Settings <PAC>
	- IP PAA <IP_PAA>
	- Port PAA <PORT_PAA>
	
    * PAA's Settings <PAA>
	- Client's Timeout: Seconds before client's session expires. <TIMEOUT_CLIENT>
	- Threads to use: Number of threads used to manage tasks on server. <WORKERS>
    - PCI expire time: Time while a session is on the server without answer for the first PAR message. <TIME_ANSWER>
	- Server's Certificates files, located under the AAA server folder. The name of the files may be changed by modifying this values.
		- CA Certificate Filename <CA_CERT>
		- Server's Certificate Filename <SERVER_CERT>
		- Server's key <SERVER_KEY>
	- Radius Server Information. <AUTH_SERVER>
		- IP of the Radius Server <AS_IP>
		- Port of the Radius Server <AS_PORT>
		- Radius' shared secret <SHARED_SECRET>

	* PRE Settings <PRE>
	- Interface where the PRE listen to incoming PAC messages <INTERFACE_PAC>
	- Port where the PRE listen to incoming PAC messages <PORT_PAC>
	- Interface where the PRE listen to incoming PAA messages <INTERFACE_PAA>
	- Port where the PRE listen to incoming PAA messages <PORT_PAA>
	- IP where PAA is listening to incoming messages <IP_PAA>
	- Port where PAA is listening to incoming messages <PORT_PAA>

 3. Building the OpenPANA softwares:

  You can just run the './configure --sysconfdir=/etc/openpana' script and 'make'.
  If the --sysconfdir option is not added, configuration files will be placed under the '/usr/local/etc' directory.

  You can also run the '--enable-debug' configure option in order to get a full debugging.

  You can also run the '--enable-aes' configure option in order to get the AES cryptographic suite available.

  You can also run the '--enable-relay' configure option in order to get the PRE functionality integrated within the PaC entity.
  
 4. OpenPANA will need a working installation of a Radius Server using EAP-TLS method.
    OpenPANA will require the following certificate files in config folder or in the current directory:
    	- ca.pem 
    	- client.pem
    	- client.pk8 (Can be obtained from client.key using: openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in client.key -out client.pk8 -nocrypt )
  
   An example of certificates and a working eap.conf (to use with freeRadius) can be found in radius_conf folder of svn root.
   
 5. After all you have 'openpaa', 'openpre' and 'openpac' in the ./src application's folder.
 
 6. By running 'make install' as root OpenPANA will be installed tipically under '/usr/local/bin' and configuration files 
    will be placed in '/etc/openpana'.

    In order to produce an executable much smaller and faster, the application can be installed by the command 'make install-strip'.

* OpenPANA can be uninstalled by the 'make uninstall' command.

If you have trouble with the build or installation process, you can
find assistance on the openapana-users@list.sourceforge.net mailing list.
